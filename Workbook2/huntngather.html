              <br />
              This game is built on a 2D isometric, it has hilarious graphics
              that develop as you complete the levels, it includes engaging
              sound and haptics, the development of the levels throughout the
              game is super creative.

              Really unique idea, to win you must do the contrary of what the
              game tells you, it is super confusing and frankly a really
              challenging game.

              mouse, it made the navigation a bit distracting but super fun to
              play with.

              Rafaël Rozendaal creates mesmerizing works that shift and change

              liked the one above, Reflection, as the interaction is smooth and
              seamless and it felt like an outer world.

              I found quite a few sketches that would turn your image into text

              has having the text editor right next to it I could see how they

              The page is so overwhelming at first that you don’t even realise

              you click them more and more appear. The colours are so
              overwhelming but harmonious at the same time, it felt like the

              Anders Hoff is a generative artist who is fascinated by patterns.
              He often finds it useful to start with a highly organized
              structure and to then look for ways to gradually disrupt it. To me
              his artworks look like planets, I like that he makes his GitHub
              available so you can see exactly how he got to this artworks.

              view, at the same time the dark shadow from below and white haze

              Hexells by Alexander Mordvintsev is a Self-Organising System of
              cells, that was trained to build textures using neighbour
              communication only. This work exposes the relation between the
              life of an individual cell, and the cell collective. The work is
              interactive with the cells and surrounding cells changing colour
              at the swipe of your mouse.
